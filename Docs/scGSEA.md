#### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

This project is for providing a user friendly method to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis between clusters (or subsets of cells in clusters). The main GSEA software has been adapted from [Broad Institute](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) and restored for compatibility with latest R distributions.
